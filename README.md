**Drowsy driver detection systems are technologies designed to identify and alert drivers who are becoming drowsy or fatigued while operating a vehicle.**

# This drowsy driver detection Project, includes:

# Eye Tracking and Blink Monitoring: 
**These systems use cameras to track a driver's eye movements and monitor the frequency and duration of eye blinks. A drowsy driver tends to have longer and more frequent blinks, which can be a sign of fatigue.**

# Facial Recognition and Analysis: 
**Facial recognition software can analyze a driver's facial features to detect signs of drowsiness, such as drooping eyelids, changes in facial expressions, or a lack of facial movement.**
